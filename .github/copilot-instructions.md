# Workshop repository — Copilot instructions

This repo is the **Azure Platform Engineering workshop**. It is intentionally split into two parts:

| Folder | Owner | Copilot scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workload-app/` | The "application team" (out of scope for this workshop) | **Read-only. No exceptions.** Do not create, edit, move, or delete any file under this path — including Dockerfiles, `.dockerignore`, or anything else. |
| `mock-alz/` | Workshop hub / shared landing zone | Read-only reference. Modify only when the chore explicitly says so. |
| `dockerfiles/` | Platform team | This is where the workload container build assets live (Dockerfiles, `.dockerignore`, nginx config, build/deploy scripts). |
| Everything else (`infra/`, `bicep/`, `.github/`, READMEs, etc.) | The platform team (you + the workshop participant) | Editable. This is where the chores happen. |

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never create, edit, move, or delete anything under `workload-app/`.** Not the `.cs`, `.csproj`, `.tsx`, `.ts`, `package.json`, `appsettings.json`, `index.html`, **and not Dockerfiles or `.dockerignore` either**. The application is treated as a finished, immutable artifact the platform team has been handed. **No exceptions.** If a chore appears to require a change inside `workload-app/`, the participant does that edit by hand — Copilot does not.
2. **Reading `workload-app/` is encouraged.** Read the code to understand what the app needs (runtime, ports, env vars, database, egress, etc.) so the platform design is grounded in reality.
3. **Dockerfiles for the app live under `dockerfiles/`**, not inside `workload-app/`. Layout:
   - `dockerfiles/backend/Dockerfile` (for the .NET 10 API in `workload-app/backend/HotelBooking.Api/`)
   - `dockerfiles/frontend/Dockerfile` (for the Vite/React SPA in `workload-app/frontend/`)
   - Any `.dockerignore`, nginx config, or build/deploy scripts go alongside them under `dockerfiles/`.
   Each Dockerfile's build context is the matching `workload-app/` subfolder, set explicitly at build time (`az acr build --file dockerfiles/backend/Dockerfile workload-app/backend/HotelBooking.Api`). The source tree stays untouched.
4. **No application-level instructions.** Do not propose or follow guidance about C#, .NET, EF Core, React, Vite, Tailwind, TypeScript, or test frameworks. Those are the application team's concern.
5. **Container base images must come from `mcr.microsoft.com` (Microsoft Container Registry), not Docker Hub.** This applies to every `FROM` line in any `Dockerfile` you author in this repo (platform-team images and the workload `Dockerfile`s allowed by rule 3). Prefer the first-party Microsoft image; if no MCR equivalent exists for a base image you need (e.g. a community runtime), stop and ask the user before falling back to Docker Hub. Examples: use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:<tag>` and `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:<tag>` for .NET, `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/nodejs:<tag>` for Node, `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/nginx:<tag>` for nginx, `mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/base/python:<tag>` (or the Azure Linux equivalent) for Python.
6. **Stay inside the current chore. Read only the current chore page (`CHORES.md` is an index — open the specific `chores/chore-NN.md` you are working on, nothing later). Do not open any `chores/details-NN.md` file (they contain hints, expected outcomes, and spoilers the participant is working through on their own). Do not name, number, or reference future chores in any artifact (docs, diagrams, Bicep comments, scripts, commit messages, chat output). Do not pre-bake parameters, SKUs, file paths, or code branches for requirements that have not been stated in the current chore.** If the current chore says "the plan should be detailed enough that the next chore can implement it", that means write a self-contained design — *not* "Chore 4 will…". The participant drives chores in order; you do not get to peek. If something genuinely must be deferred, say **"out of scope for this design"** or **"a follow-up implementation"** without naming or numbering the future work. The only files where you may write `Chore N` are `CHORES.md`, `README.md`, and files under `chores/` — nowhere else.
7. The container registry **must** be publicly accessible (not behind a private endpoint) to make chores possible. 

## What this workshop is about

Hub-and-spoke Azure Landing Zone with **distributed Private DNS zones** (each workload resource group owns its own Private DNS zones, linked back to the hub vnet). The participant works through a sequence of chores that cover spoke onboarding, workload design, Bicep implementation with AVM, deployment, container build/rollout, multi-environment support, and CI/CD with OIDC. See [CHORES.md](../CHORES.md) for the authoritative, ordered list of chores; each chore page links to its matching detail page under `chores/` for hints.

Architecture diagrams referenced from Markdown design docs must be authored via the **`drawio` skill** and exported as PNG with embedded XML so the source stays editable.

## How to work in this repo

- Prefer **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)** for any Bicep — see [.github/instructions/azure-verified-modules-bicep.instructions.md](.github/instructions/azure-verified-modules-bicep.instructions.md).
- Follow **Microsoft CAF naming** — see [.github/instructions/azure-naming.instructions.md](.github/instructions/azure-naming.instructions.md).
- Architecture diagrams referenced from Markdown must be authored via the **`drawio` skill** under [.github/skills/drawio/SKILL.md](.github/skills/drawio/SKILL.md) and exported as PNG (with embedded `.drawio` XML) so the source stays editable.
- Use the **`azure-principal-architect`** or **`plan`** chat modes for design conversations, and **`bicep-plan` / `bicep-implement`** for IaC work.
- Run **`azure-deployment-preflight`** (Bicep what-if + permission checks) before any `az deployment` command.

## When in doubt

Never edit anything inside `workload-app/` — there is no "ask first" path for that folder; refuse and tell the user to do it by hand. Ask the user before:
- Adding new top-level folders.
- Introducing a new Azure service that wasn't already on the table for the current chore.
- Running anything that touches a real Azure subscription (deployments, role assignments, resource creation).

## other important instructions
- the container registry, monitoring, and the public frontend are the only workload components that can have a public endpoint. Every other service must be locked down with private endpoints and/or service endpoints, and all inter-service communication must stay on the Microsoft backbone via Private DNS and peering.
- you must make sure the local az cli principal has RBAC permissions to deploy all the resources in the Bicep templates, including the ability to create role assignments for user-assigned managed identities. If any permission is missing, the deployment will fail. Use `az role assignment create` to grant the necessary permissions before deployment.
- the **Azure SQL Entra admin must be the workload's user-assigned managed identity**, not the local deploying principal. SQL is reachable only through its private endpoint from inside the spoke, so the deploying principal cannot (and should not) be the data-plane admin. Wire the MI as the Entra admin in Bicep and let the application authenticate passwordlessly.

## Self-check before you finish a turn

Before returning your final answer or saving any artifact, grep your own output and any files you wrote/edited for the regex `Chore \d`. If it matches **and** the hit is not inside `CHORES.md`, `README.md`, or a file under `chores/`, you have violated rule 6 — go back and remove the reference (replace with "a follow-up implementation" or "out of scope for this design") before responding.
