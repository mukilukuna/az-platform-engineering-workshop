# Workload network exposure rules

These rules are **not negotiable** and apply to every design document, diagram, Bicep file, and chore artifact in this repo. They exist because later chores in the workshop depend on this exact topology (ACR build agents must be reachable, Monitor ingestion endpoints must be reachable from the runtime, and the SPA is the only user-facing surface). Locking these down breaks the workshop.

## Services that MUST stay public

The following resources are **public on purpose**. Do not put them behind a private endpoint, do not flip `publicNetworkAccess` to `Disabled`, do not create private DNS zones for their `privatelink.*` namespaces, and do not add them to a Private Link Scope (AMPLS) for the workshop spoke.

| Resource | Reason it stays public |
| --- | --- |
| Azure Container Registry (ACR) | `az acr build` and image pulls during chores need public reachability; the registry is workshop-shared. **Must be set to "Allow All Networks"** — no IP allowlist, no selected-networks rules, no service-endpoint-only access. ACR Tasks build agents come from Microsoft-managed IP space that is not in the workshop spoke, so any network restriction will break the build/deploy chores. |
| Log Analytics workspace | Monitor ingestion + query for the workshop runs over the public endpoint. |
| Application Insights | Telemetry ingestion from the workload runs over the public endpoint. |
| Data Collection Endpoint / Data Collection Rule (if used) | Same ingestion path as above. |
| The workload **frontend** (SPA hosting / Front Door / Static Web App / public App Service) | This is the only user-facing surface. |

Concretely, in Bicep this means **none** of the following may appear for ACR or any Monitor resource:

- `privateEndpoints: [...]` blocks
- `publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'`
- `networkRuleSet` / `networkAcls` with `defaultAction: 'Deny'` (ACR must keep the default `Allow` — do not add `ipRules` or `virtualNetworkRules` either; "Allow All Networks" is the required network mode)
- Private DNS zones or zone groups referencing:
  - `privatelink.azurecr.io`
  - `privatelink.{region}.data.azurecr.io`
  - `privatelink.monitor.azure.com`
  - `privatelink.oms.opinsights.azure.com`
  - `privatelink.ods.opinsights.azure.com`
  - `privatelink.agentsvc.azure-automation.net`
  - `privatelink.applicationinsights.azure.com`
  - `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` **when** it is the AI/LA ingestion storage (the workload's own storage accounts still go private)
- `azureMonitorPrivateLinkScopes` / AMPLS resources scoped to the workshop spoke

## Services that MUST stay private

Everything else in the workload spoke is **private-only** and reachable through private endpoints + Private DNS zones linked back to the hub vnet. Non-exhaustive list:

- Azure SQL (private endpoint only; Entra admin = workload managed identity; deploying principal has no data-plane access)
- Key Vault
- Storage accounts owned by the workload (blob/file/queue/table)
- App Configuration
- Service Bus / Event Hubs / Event Grid topics
- Cosmos DB
- Container Apps internal ingress / App Service with private endpoint (backend tier)
- Any other PaaS data/control plane used by the workload

For each of these the design must include:

1. A private endpoint in the workload spoke subnet.
2. `publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'`.
3. A Private DNS zone **co-located in the workload resource group** (distributed Private DNS model) and linked to the hub vnet.

## When designing or implementing

- Do not "harden" ACR or Monitor by adding private endpoints "just to be consistent." That is a regression, not an improvement.
- If a chore appears to require putting ACR or Monitor behind a private endpoint, stop and re-read the chore — it does not.
- Architecture diagrams must show ACR and the Monitor stack outside the private-endpoint boundary (e.g. annotated "public endpoint — workshop requirement").

## Self-check before you finish

Before saving any Bicep file, design markdown, or diagram, scan your output for these regexes. If any match **and** the surrounding resource is ACR, Log Analytics, Application Insights, a Data Collection Endpoint/Rule, or an AMPLS, you have violated this instruction — revert and re-design.

- `privatelink\.(azurecr|monitor|oms\.opinsights|ods\.opinsights|agentsvc|applicationinsights)`
- `azureMonitorPrivateLinkScopes`
- `publicNetworkAccess:\s*'Disabled'` near a `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries`, `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces`, `Microsoft.Insights/components`, or `Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints` resource
- A `privateEndpoints` array on an ACR or Monitor AVM module (`br/public:avm/res/container-registry/registry`, `br/public:avm/res/operational-insights/workspace`, `br/public:avm/res/insights/component`, `br/public:avm/res/insights/data-collection-endpoint`)
